    "### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. \n",
    " 1. First, I converted the images to grayscale,\n",
    " \n",
    " ![gray][gray]\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. then I used a Gaussian filter to reduce noise in the image. \n",
    " \n",
    " ![gauss][gauss]\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Next, I detected the edges using the Canny edge detector with the following thresholds:\n",
    "     - low_threshold = 50\n",
    "     - high_threshold = 150\n",
    " \n",
    " ![canny][canny]\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. To consider only the region of interest, I applied a polyline mask using \"bitwise and\" operation between the mask and the edge detected image to get a region of interest.\n",
    " \n",
    " ![mask][mask]\n",
    " \n",
    " here is the image of the region of interest\n",
    " \n",
    " ![roi][roi]\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. In the last step of the pipeline, I applied the Hough transform to get the final image overlayed with the lane lines.\n",
    " \n",
    " ![hough][hough]\n",
    " \n",
    " The following settings were chosen for the Hough transform:\n",
    "    - **rho = 2** distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid\n",
    "    - **theta = pi/180** angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid\n",
    "    - **threshold = 30** specifies the minimum number of votes (intersections in a given grid cell) a candidate line needs to have to make it into the output.\n",
    "    - **min_line_length = 100** is the minimum length of a line (in pixels) that will be accepted in the output\n",
    "    - **max_line_gap = 160** is the maximum distance (again, in pixels) between segments that will allowed to be connected into a single line\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by using a simple linear least squares method. Using the following equation this yields the parameters ($m$ and $b$) for the straight lines $y = mx + b$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\beta} = (X^{T} X)^{-1} X^{T} y;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\beta} = [b, m]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows the final result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![result][result]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential shortcoming would be what happens when light conditions change. This will lead to wrong threshold settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another shortcoming could be curvy roads or different camera angles. This would lead to wrong region of interest selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement would be to use colour maps from the Open CV api which detects a change in colour within the region_of_interest and performs depending on the colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential improvement could be to adjust the region of interest for curvy roads. And also to use polynomials of higher order in the draw_lines function. This would result in bending output lines similar to the lane lines in curves."
